# Time Series Augmentation Libraries (fraug & pyFraug)

This is the repository for team 02 of the Efficient AI Algorithms in Rust seminar in SoSe 2025. Our task is to create a fast time series augmentation library in Rust and provide Python bindings for it.

Our Rust crate can be found in `fraug/` and the Python bindings in `pyfraug/`. All additional information is written in the corresponding READMEs.
